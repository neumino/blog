Hoi!

I am Michel, software engineer at [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com), part of
the Trust and Safety org. I was previously working at YouTube Ads (Google) and RethinkDB.

My professional interests lie in landscapes governed by complex, nuanced and strong
requirements (e.g. privacy, policies, etc.) and building an infrastructure that
- Scales for more traffic, larger teams and more complex products
- Is resilient to time (employee churn, evolving requirements etc.)
- Significantly help the business

I am currently located in Amsterdam after having spent 11 years in the San Francisco Bay area.

This is a little blog that I use to write down personal notes and other arbitrary
thoughts. None of the content is sponsored/endorsed by my current or previous employers.
