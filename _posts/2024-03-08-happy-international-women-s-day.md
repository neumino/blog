title: Happy International Women's Day!

{% include JB/setup %}

Today is International Women’s Day – this is an opportunity to celebrate women’s achievement across the world, but also to consciously think about how we can achieve a better world, a gender equal one.

I’ll maybe slightly digress from my usual posts about growing as a software engineer, but first I’m wishing all the women out there an amazing day, filled with love, excitement and appreciation for everything you do.

I’ve grown a lot in both personally and professionally thanks to the amazing, fearless and aspiring women in my life. I was privileged to have such connections and I’m grateful for every one of them.

We all grew up in a society that comes with biases (against women but also many other stereotypes), and these biases still live in us. They are extremely hard *but not impossible* to remove as long as we try to do better and do our best to build a more inclusive society. Not only is this the right thing to do, it will help you grow as a person and/or as a software engineer – I professionally learned a lot from women who were amazing technical leads and/or experts in their respective fields. Don’t miss on an opportunity because you of some silly/old unconscious bias.

Last but not least, I hope that today’s celebration will continue for the rest of the year – that we will keep striving for women’s equality.
