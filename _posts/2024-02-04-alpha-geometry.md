Google Deepmind just released AlphaGeometry, an AI system capable of solving geometry problem on par with Olympiad gold medalists.

The combination of a symbolinc deduction engine (that searches for a proof) and a language model that adds auxiliary point when no search were found is pretty interesting. It is different than the ongoing discussions around which LLM models (GPT-4, Mistral 7B, Claude etc.) is performing better and is proof that other interesting progress is being made in the AI field.
