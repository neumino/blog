This post is especially relevant if you work in Europe/Asia in a large tech company that’s headquartered in the USA (e.g. Google, Databricks, Meta, Uber etc.) – but also in general if you work with Americans and are not American (e.g. if you moved to the USA).

It’s likely that your most senior peers/leadership are located in the USA. Beyond the timezones hurdle, this likely means that you will be evaluated as an American – or at least from an American perspective,

The main cultural difference that negatively impacts non-Americans is around confidence. For example, looking at promo packets from two candidates that lead and executed a whole project:

- The European will write “I helped with <X>”, “I was part of the team that launched <X>” etc.
- The American will write “I spearheaded project <X>”, “I revamped the whole architecture to launch <X>”, “I lead and empower the team to execute <X> in time” etc.

This difference in tone results in peers (or promo committee) having more or less confidence in your skills/performance. In my experience this is one of the largest differences that explain why in-org promo happens at the same cadence across continents but senior levels (L6+) are disproportionately in the USA (since these promos tend to be reviewed globally, i.e. in the USA)

This inequality can be resolved in two ways:

1. Everyone behaves like an American
2. Everyone understands cultural differences and can adapt as needed

My take is that while we can successfully raise awareness of 2/ managers, it seems very difficult to do it with everyone in the company. As such 2/ by itself won’t work, and you also need to do 1/ if you want to become a very senior IC/manager.

I’ll close this post by also asking my American peers to realize that not everyone grew up in a competitive environment where you have to exert a lot of confidence in your everyday life – so someone being “shy” doesn’t necessarily mean they are not good or that they didn’t do the work well.

Note: I’m aware that there are other issues that result in leadership being mostly in the USA, e.g. important projects tend to be reorged in the USA…
