title: Lenovo duet review
---
{% include JB/setup %}

I recently bought a Lenovo duet because I wanted a secure tablet.

There are many reviews about the Duet and the TL;DR is that this a cheap device (300 USD)
with an amazing price to value ratio. That being said, I wanted to talk a bit more about
the ChromeOS experience on a tablet.

It is great.

As the world is moving to mobile first, sometimes browsers are being ignored.
ChromeOS let's you install/use any Android App, meaning that you are likely
always going to have the app you care about. On the other hand, if there is no
Android app (or if you cannot use it), you can just create a shortcut on Chrome
that feels like an app. On my end there are two use cases that I really enjoy:

- I can use the [Nanit](https://www.nanit.com) android app to keep an eye on my
daughter while she's sleeping
- I can create a WhatsApp shortcut (feels like an app) such that I can use WhatsApp
on whatever device I currently have opened.

The device is not as fast/sharp as my phone (Pixel 3 XL) but it's fast enought that
I have never feel hindered when playing games, watching movies or just browsing the
internet.
