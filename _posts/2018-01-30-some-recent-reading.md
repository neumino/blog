I recently read a few books about poverty in the United States:

- _[$2.00 a Day: Living on Almost Nothing in America](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QPHNUFO/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title)_ from Kathryn Edin and H. Luke Shaefer 
- _[American Hunger: The Pulitzer Prize-Winning Washington Post Series (A Vintage Short)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LRIXKS8/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title)_ from Eli Saslow
- _[Fire in the Ashes: Twenty-Five Years Among the Poorest Children in America](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007MGPXO8/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title)_ from Jonathan Kozol
- _[Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B010ZXKCAO/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title)_ from Matthew Desmond

I do not plan to write a review of all these books since you can probably
find some on [goodreads.com](https://www.goodreads.com) but these books paint a
very interesting picture of poverty, and were eye-opening about the situation in
America.

Beside learning about (extreme) poverty and how it impacts people lifes, it was
also a reminder about how lucky I have been in my life. While my parents were
far from being rich, I grew up in a stable environement, with a loving family,
a roof over my head and food on my plate.

If you have a few hours to kill, I would really recommend reading these books.
You will likely see the world through a different lens after that.
