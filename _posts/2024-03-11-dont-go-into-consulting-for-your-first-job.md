title: Don‚Äôt go into consulting as your first job

{% include JB/setup %}

When I graduated from Centrale Paris (aka CentraleSupelec, one of France‚Äôs top engineering schools), most of my classmates who studied computer sciences went to do consulting. Being an anomaly üòÖ, I moved to the Silicon Valley to work for a startup instead. This was an amazing decision (even though it happened by sheer luck).

The main reason I‚Äôm advising new grads against joining a consulting company is that you won‚Äôt have the chance to own a system ‚Äì you will own a project at best. Shipping a project is fundamentally different from owning it ‚Äì you can take shortcuts, write poor code and design brittle systems without too much of a (short term) consequence 

From there, the experience and knowledge you will gain will be shallower than if you were working in an engineering company. You will keep building/shipping new solutions without the chance to look back and learn from it ‚Äì which is what allows us to grow. This is similar to how job hopping or constantly switching teams isn‚Äôt always what‚Äôs best for one‚Äôs growth ‚Äì you have to stick a bit to your work to understand its weaknesses.

My limited experience with candidates coming from consulting companies is that
- They struggle to get a job in engineering first companies (e.g. Google, Meta, Databricks etc.) because they lack the relevant experiences during the cross functional/tech fit/design interviews
- If hired, they seem to struggle because the expectations are different ‚Äì e.g. the quality of your work matters much more and peers will call out technical limitations of your proposal/work regardless of how well you can sell/present it.
I however do not have enough data to say that this is always true, but if someone has more than anecdotal data, I would be interested to peek at it.

Last but not least, I think the joy of being an engineer is to care for something you built ‚Äì how many of us have spent way too much time perfecting an open source project just because it was our ‚Äúbaby‚Äù? You can‚Äôt find this pleasure if you switch companies/projects every 6 months.

For folks in my network doing consulting, I would be interested to hear your take on this post! I may be missing some perspectives/insights
