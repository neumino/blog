title: Firefox Focus, a brilliant use case
---
{% include JB/setup %}

Mozilla recently [announced](https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/lightweight-browser-focus-does-less-which-is-much-more/)
Firefox Focus, a new lightweight browser that is the perfect fit for one off
session. For example a friend just sent you an article and you want to be able
to quicky read it.

- Focus is shipped with a native ad blocker. Load the content you are
looking for, not the ads.

- Focus has a single screen, no tabs. This means a faster start up. There is no need
for your phone to load unrelated tabs.

- Focus clears cookies and history after each session. Again this means a fresh
(e.g faster) start but more importantly you are less vulnerable to a whole set
of attacks like [CSRF attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery).
No one can trick you into sharing an article on Facebook since you are not even logged in.

What I believe will make Focus successful is that it tries to solve a very
specific yet common use case: quickly open a link or perform a search. You can
also safely make it your default browser as once a page is open in Focus, you
can easily switch to any other browser.

Grab it for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.focus) or for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1055677337?mt=8).
