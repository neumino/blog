You should write code thatâ€™s readable for others since code is written once but read multiple times. Forget all the rare, complex and exotic syntaxes that people wouldnâ€™t get at once, write simple and dumb code as much as possible.

When I was a new grad, I wrongly assumed that I had to write code using all the capabilities of a given language â€“ JavaScript in my case. The code I wrote was working well, but it wasnâ€™t necessarily easy to read â€“ especially if you didnâ€™t know all the quirks of JavaScript (this was before ES6)

In my case, it probably was fine since I was the only engineer working on the frontend and the node.js libraries. This was however very different from when I was leading YouTube Ads serving infrastructure where we had

- A very complex business logic â€“ e.g. if you want to know if you can monetize a page, you need to compute hundreds of decisions (from who owns the video, if you paid the tax in that given country, if the user is a kid etc.)
- A very large set of engineers/teams working on the stack at the same time

At this time, having simple code was extremely valuable:

- Itâ€™s much easier to review â€“ and therefore safer since reviewers can focus on business logic and edge cases rather than exotic/questionable syntax.
- Code was consistent, so it was overall much easier to read, grep and sed. Itâ€™s a virtuous circle, people tend to stick to the existing style making the code base naturally simpler.

One interesting fact from my time at Google was how you canâ€™t throw errors in C++ at Google (same pattern as in golang) â€“ this was a conscious decision from Google to keep code simpler.

If you want proof of why writing readable code matters, you can probably look at the code you wrote while being a new grad (or while at school) and see how easy it is for you to understand and be able to update. Personally, my old code is terrible ðŸ˜…
